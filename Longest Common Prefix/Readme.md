# Longest Common Prefix

Write a function to find the _**longest common prefix**_ **_string_** amongst an **array of strings**.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

    Example 1:
    Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
    Output: "fl"

    Example 2:
    Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
    Output: ""
    Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
