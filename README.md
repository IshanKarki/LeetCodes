# LeetCodes Problems and Solutions

This is the repository consisting the solutions to some problems of LeetCode in python. 

It contains problems of various difficulties, but at first I'm just planning to solve my way to the easy ones first, slowly progressing to the medium ones upto the hard ones. This github repo is a part of the daily leetcoding challenge as the quest for not losing a streak even for a single day at solving problems, _**simply because they're exciting.**_
Every single files contain a specific question problem and their respective solution, also in some describing briefly how they work, while in others just the lab and the comments inside them.
